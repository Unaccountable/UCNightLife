# Project Statement

While education is the primary reason for attending UC, social interaction is also extremely important for mental wellbeing and making friends. When attending school for the first time, many students miss out on the opportunities of University of Cincinnati’s night life. This is half of the college experience, but students are unaware that they are missing out on UC’s nightlife due to the lack of information that is online. Our platform is designed to fix this issue by giving students the information on UC’s nightlife to assist them with their nightlife college experiences. Since UC already has a virtual tour of campus, we would like to expand on the idea and encompass the entire Cincinnati region. We will be including downtown and on/off campus locations among other points of interest around Cincinnati. 

# Solution

The solution to solve the problem of new students missing out on the unique night life experience at the University of Cincinnati is UC Night Life. This platform will allow for students to find new experiences at and around the University of Cincinnati by providing them with the necessary information on common places and points of interest in and around the campus. The information will include hours of operation, what to expect when you arrive, as well as other useful information.  

# Project Objectives/Goals

The goal of UC Night Life is to provide new students or returning students with a way to socialize, especially after the quarantine time, and find new places near campus. Additionally, the platform should allow for socializing with people with varying backgrounds and to figure out what to do with themselves as they become independent adults. The platform will provide information about locations around campus as well as traditional on campus activities that might go overlooked by students such as “On the Green” for Club Sports, Welcome Weekend special events, as well as unofficial events around the University.
